# Wine-Quality_prediction-App
I have created an app using streamlit to predict the quality and type of wine. I have initially preprocessed the dataset of red wine and white wine, figuring out the content of different constituents in the wine and setting threshold as to what content of a constituent makes it good and bad and benchmarked the model (random forest) against different models like regression, SVM Classifier and showed its superiority. This was done as the part of course work/project for course EE769- Introduction to Machine Learning in IIT Bombay.
